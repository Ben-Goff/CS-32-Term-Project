Dustin:

* Strengths: I'd like to think that I'm good at planning out code and getting ideas onto pseudo-code
  and first draft code. I can also keep code organized and readable.
* Weaknesses: Frankly I have an unhealthy aversion to testing, and I basically always write out all
  the code before writing any tests, which isn't a great habit to have when writing complex code. I
  also tend to get picky with how code is organized out and tend to prioritize this over getting
  everything implemented first.

**Project Idea(s):** _Fill this in with three unique ideas! (Due by March 1)_

### Idea 1

Our first idea is to create a productivity-boosting application that creates a more involved
connection between the user and the app. Planners and reminders are productivity tools that work for
some but what they lack is a way react to when things don't go perfectly according to plan
(examples include getting stuck on a certain task or procrastination). Users will enter in their
tasks/assignments and their due date, and the app will tailor a schedule that whittles away at each
task while preventing the user from getting overwhelmed. Furthermore, the user will update the app
with the progress that they have made, and the app will react accordingly, updating the schedule and
providing suggestions on how the user can improve their productivity.

Requirements: This app attempts to address the problem of unproductive habits such as
procrastination, spending too much time on a certain task, and leaving distractions open on a
physical/digital workspace.

The first crucial feature is a method of collecting user input on goals, their deadlines, and
schedule of non goal-related commitments; this is how the app collects the data that it will
process. The challenge of this feature will be making the input process as non-tedious and 
non-intrusive as possible while still collecting sufficient data.

The second crucial feature is a method of assigning blocks of time towards getting a list of tasks
done, each of which by a certain due date. This is the core scheduling feature of the app, and 
the challenge here will be determining the core algorithm to fulfill this feature.

The third is a way for the user to let the app know on the progress that they are making, and a way
for the app to update the schedule according to this progress. This is how the app becomes 
flexible to unplanned outcomes. Perhaps the app can update the tasks and due dates and simply 
remake the schedule, but it may be necessary to implement multiple "lifestyles" of productivity 
that work best for different users.

The final requirement is for the app to detect potential issues such as frequent rescheduling, or 
the user reporting that little progress has been made on a task, and provide recommendations 
accordingly. This is so that the app can help the user improve, rather than simply reinforce, 
productivity. Deciding on how the app should detect and categorize such issues is speculated to 
be the most difficult task of the project.

### Idea 3

**Mentor TA:** _Put your mentor TA's name and email here once you're assigned one!_

## Meetings

_On your first meeting with your mentor TA, you should plan dates for at least the following
meetings:_

**Specs, Mockup, and Design Meeting:** _(Schedule for on or before March 15)_

**4-Way Checkpoint:** _(Schedule for on or before April 5)_

**Adversary Checkpoint:** _(Schedule for on or before April 12 once you are assigned an adversary
TA)_
